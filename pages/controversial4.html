            <h1>Number 9: Does anyone have more information on </h1>
            <p>this video?Submission statement: 
I found this clip in a old video on daily motion about daylight sightings of UFOs in Europe. 
In this particular clip the narrator just claimed that it was shot in Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ with no further context. 
Does anyone know the origin of this case? Who shot the video, did people attempt to debunk it? </p>
