            <p>video todayI was at work today and my wife said something weird just happened. She sent me this video that captures movement when the dogs are barking etc. She was emptying the dishwasher in the kitchen which is in the other room about 20 feet behind the camera and you may hear that at the beginning of the video. She only noticed the door open to the closet at first. I had my AirPods in when she sent me the video and heard the voice immediately, i quickly realized she hadn’t heard this yet, it definitely gave me chills. She’s been really freaked out since after I made her aware of it. I’m really pretty quick to explain away certain things that happen around the house but these two happening right next to each other is too great to ignore. My first impression was the word “hiya” but when I keep listening to it I’m hearing “taya” more and more. Let me know what you think you hear or if I’m just losing it haha </p>
