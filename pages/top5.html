            <p>encounterI believe I have been visited by Alien Grey's since infancy. 
Their visits/abductions were somewhat sporadic but mostly around the time I would be experiencing hardships.
I sketched one visit here. I was naked. I am biologically female. I sleep naked, so thats the explanation for the nudity. The metallic environment was warm. No humidity. Same environment I was always in whenever I was visited. I always assumed it was their ship. 
I was 19. Going through an awful breakup. They visited. One Grey who I was familiar with (They had 3 dark "freckles" on their cheek) showed "affection" for the first time. I was sobbing asking why I wasn't good enough for my ex. This Grey "comforted" me. Half embracing me. 
They communicate telepathically, their faces do not express emotion and always stay in the same stoic state. As if they don't have facial muscles. 
They communicated during the embrace, " Some are created to be cruel. This is arbitrarily. I regret that you, of all, met a cruel being."
I've posted on and off in some of these groups. Kind of working up the courage to start sharing stories. 
Feel free to comment thoughts, opinions, tell me I'm retarded. Etc.</p>
