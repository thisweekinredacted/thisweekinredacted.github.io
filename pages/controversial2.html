            <h1>Number 7: That time the Queen kidnapped 10 Native </h1>
            <p>children and they were never heard or seen from ever again.One quick Google search will turn up results from sources such as Reuters, usatoday or even Snopes stating that such an event never happened and that all claims stating as such are "obviously" false however to the trained eye who knows to look a little deeper past these publicity fronts used to brainwash the masses and convice them of their own "truth", a deeper, more sinister story lies in wait.
The day is October 10th, 1964. The location, a residential school located in Kamloops, Canada about a 5 hr drive from the American border. The Queen and Prince Philip had decided to come pay a visit to the lands first generational, youthful inhabitants for reasons to this day still unbeknownst. I introduce to you the only surviving member of a group of 3 boys who claim to have bare witnessed to the abduction of about 10 children whos grieving parents to this day still have no knowledge as to what became of them. William Coombes recounted that said group of 10 children were amoung the brightest in their classes and had left with the Queen and Prince Phillip on a "Picnic". "In October, 1964 when I was 12 years old, I was an inmate at the Kamloops school and we were visited by the Queen of England and Prince Phillip. I remember it was strange because they came by themselves, no big fanfare or nothing. But I recognized them and the school principal told us it was the Queen and we all got given new clothes and good food for the first time in months the day before she arrived.The day the Queen got to the school, I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with her and her husband and some of the priests, down to a meadow near Dead Man’s Creek. I remember it was weird because we all had to bend down and kiss her foot, a white laced boot.After awhile, I saw the Queen leave the picnic with ten children from the school, and those kids never returned. We never heard anything more about them and never met them again even when we were older. They were all from around there but they all vanished.The group that disappeared was seven boys and three girls, in age from six to fourteen years old. They were all from the smart group in class. Two of the boys were brothers and they were Metis from Quesnel. Their last name was Arnuse or Arnold. I don’t remember the others, just an occasional first name like Cecilia and there was an Edward.What happened was also witnessed by my friend George Adolph, who was 11 years old at the time and a student there too. But he's dead now.".
Williams was subject to multiple forms of abuse during his time at the school that included being tied down to a wooden rack where he had been physically assaulted by one of the Male members whos name was Brother Murphy of the Church who worked as staff at the time. In addition to this, Williams also stated to have seen the same male staff throw an eight year old girl to her death from a balcony aswell as bury another with another priest in the schools orchard late one night. Why am I including all of these extra details you may ask? It is indisputable that such horrors and tragedies occured at the Kamloops residential school as a mass grave site filled with children was just uncovered in recent years, what would it be for a group of 10 children to go missing and vanish into thin air
Fast forward now to 2013, An international court located in Brussels (ICLCJ) found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the disaperance of 10 native children from the catholic residential school in Kamloops B.C. The arrest warrant issued by six judges of the international common law court of Justice in Brussels had been issued however Canadian courts refused to her the case. From what I have been able to dig up, nothing ever became of that arrest warrant so I dont know how much weight this court in brussels held however I am sure arresting the Queen regardless of who indicts her isnt as easy as it sounds as far as an arrest process goes. So, what ever happened to William you might ask? He died suddenly in hospital shortly before he was to go public about the abduction and disapperance of his school mates. He was aged 59 and in good health, scheduled to be a primary witness at the opening session of the international Tribunal into Crimes of the Church and State on September 12th in London, England. A source close to William claimed that he had gone to the hospital and while there underwent "testing" despite the fact that William had always been of sound health and never had any adverse health events in his past. During this testing, Williams health began to deteriorate, "I last saw William ten days ago, on the eve of my departure for a European speaking tour, and he looked better than i had seen him in years" according to his partner Mae. His cause of death remains undisclosed. The vancouver coroners office refuses to comment on Williams death. The Kamloops school was closed in 1977 and the parents of the missing children have to this day been prevented from taking any such legal action in the court of law, all but being dismissed and from what i can tell, this was the reasoning for such matters to be brought to the attention of the international common law court in Brussels.
Kevin Annett is the name of the man who set out the "Prima facie" evidence for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillips personal involvement in the disapperance of the 10 native children who were abducted between the dates of October 5th-13th never to be seen or heard from again. Since 2008, Queen Elizabeth and the Canadian government have continuously denied requests by the ITCCS'S for excavation even though a mass grave site has been discovered moreso recently in the last few years.
Now, with that being said regardless of wether or not you believe this event ever took place, you can be the judge of that but one irrefutable fact is that this school in Kamloops was one of over 130 schools of its kind operating in Canada between 1874 and 1977 with the last residential school all but having been closed in 1997 (Who was in charge of said school and why it was allowed to stay open is still a hot topic up for debate). This time in Canadas history portrays a very dark reality where Native children effectively had their identitys stripped away in an attempt to assimilate them to the ways of the Catholic church. Sexual, Physical, Emotional and Psychological abuse went on rampant for over a hundred years unchecked and the effects of these schools can still be seen in our countries native identifying members to this day. So with that being said, what are we thinking? Adrenochrome harvesting? Satanic rituals involving Child Sacrafice? Id love to know what you think in the comments.
Edit: People are having a meltdown in the comments over a brief oversight I had when stating that this event happened when the Queen came to visit during the 100th anniversary of confederation which took place in 1967 and not when the events of said abduction of 10 native children took place in October of 1964. I have removed the line "The Queen and Prince Philip had come to visit Canada to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Confederation" and nothing more. Thanks!
