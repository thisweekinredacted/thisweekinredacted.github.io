            <h1>So My Fiance And I Had To Feed The </h1>
            <p>Neighbors Cat And This Is What We Walk Up OnSo I immediately ask my fiance do you think that's a real person or what ? She says I'm sure it's a statue or some kind of decoration. Well we go in the house to see almost every single closet, pantry, bathroom door wide open which who knows maybe she keeps it that way but it was very odd. Anyways we close all the doors , feed the cats , and hear a thump from upstairs. Mind you the two cats are with us. We locked up the house and sure enough whatever the hell was standing there was gone !! Never going in that house again . You could cut the air with a knife. 
TLDR ; went to feed cats and saw this figure in the window my fiance brushed off. Every door in the house was open and when we left the figure/ghost/puppet thing was gone .</p>
