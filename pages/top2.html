            <h1>People Are Different Since The </h1>
            <p>PandemicIs it just me? 
People seem different, I absolutely loathe retail shopping now. Rude, selfish and inconsiderate people are everywhere that give you the death stare. It feels like they're in their own world and nothing else outside of it matters. Same goes for driving, I love driving but now I loathe that too. 
It's like people have very short fuses, always reacting to things that should never be a problem in the first place. Everyone I speak too has constant brain fog and it's like they're in a trance.
I used to enjoy being out in the city. Now I don't, its very much a different vibe.
EDIT 1: Wow, it's quite clear that I'm not alone here. Maybe us that see things outside of the consortium can clearly see things going down hill.
EDIT 2: Did not expect it to blow up with so many like-minded individuals. I guess now is the time to form strong communities within the areas we live. </p>
