            <h1>I'll start caring whether or not </h1>
            <p>Russell Brand had some questionable sex a decade or 2 ago when the media starts caring what Bill Gates or Prince Andrew was doing on Epstein's island, or when it starts naming the customers Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of supplying trafficked minors to.And I'll care about what one former US president is or isn't guilty of when the media starts caring what other former US presidents are or are not guilty of (or even what the current one's been up to lately).
And I'll care about a more powerful country invading a less powerful country when the media reports the conflict and its context in exactly the same tone and with the same degree of neutrality versus moral outrage as it uses when the more powerful country in question is the USA (or any other NATO member).
Until that day, the mainstream media and everyone who repeats its talking points on social media is nought but idle gossip and the sound of one hand clapping.
Until that day I could not give less fucks about who the msm says any fucker fucked or didn't fuck, so fuck the msm. Let anyone it fucks with tell it to fuck the fuck off with its farcical fuckery.</p>
