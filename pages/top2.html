            <p>look by the driver side (right side)So earlier in the year I had a car accident. A 4x4 did an illegal u turn and t boned my car. I was driving and my partner was in the passenger seat. Once everyone was out and by the side of the road away from the accident I quickly wanted to grab some photos of the accident I took four pictures and I was very shaky when taking the pics and one came out the most clear. In the pic I have attached nobody was there when I took the photo but standing by the driver side door (where I was) looks to me like a man who actually reminds me of my grandfather who passed away when I was 12 and then people who knew him think it‚Äôs him too. May I add my accident happened right near a cemetery But yeah lemme know what you guys think.</p>
