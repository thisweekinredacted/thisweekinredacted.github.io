Here is my full story 
I was 19 at the time, it was 2017 i lived in Vidor tx,
I have been prone  to sleep paralysis, this wasn't that, mainly because I was able to move, 
I was woke up and looked at the doorway of my bedroom, and I see a figure standing in the doorway 
So I sit up and lean my back on the wall and I get a better look at the thing in the doorway and I see
A 6 foot tall mantis looking thing, it had two legs and mantis looking arms but the front of the law was made of 4 long fingers, it had eyes that wrap around the top of its head, the eyes were as black as obsidian glass 
It looked really skinny, if it were a human I'd say it were malnourished I could see it's ribs and everything, 
It was a pale greenish gray color,
About the time i realize what I'm looking at I said "what the fuck" out loud and thennit rushed at me, 
I did what any reasonable person in that situation would do with their back too wall, 
I punched it between its big black eyes, I felt it's skin on my knuckles, it felt like a mushroom ya know kinda squishy, 
As my fist made contact with it there was a blinding white flash,
Then I woke up laying flat in my bed seemingly tucked In, 
There was a painting my girlfriend had been working on in the living room,
It was tacked to the wall with thumbtacks on all 4 corners and it had been ripped from the bottom to the center without any of the tacks falling out, it wasn't like that when I went to bed
I lived on the second floor of an apartment complex at the time,
I don't know how it would have gotten in.
Earlier this year I made a post about it because i just couldnt shake the feeling that it wasnt a normal sleep paralysis, (I really can't tell you about the other sleep paralysis events I've had because ive alway known they were sleep paralysis and i jusg kinda forgot about them), 
So after I make this post I start getting comments  telling me that I'm not the only one who has seen it
People told me about r/Mantisencounters,  my jaw dropped because the drawings on there match exactly what I saw
Let me be extremely clear, I wish this was a bad dream,
The evidence tells me otherwise 
Don't think I'll ever forget those big black eyes
Here is my orginal post  about it if you were wondering
