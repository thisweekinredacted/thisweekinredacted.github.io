            <h1>The forgotten lore of supersized </h1>
            <p>spiders in cathedrals and churchesIn Bram Stoker's Dracula-  an inspiring book in many ways in terms of dark mythological creature lore-  Van Helsing illustrates a point about unnatural life with the story of an abnormally large spider: 
"There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day?....Do you know all the mystery of life and death?.... Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps?"
The story of this centuries-old, freakishly large spider that Van Helsing describes as growing fat from oil lamps is likely exaggerated for the dramatic purposes of a horror novel, however it chimes with a real life documented source- Volume 88 of the Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany (1821). This source was published 70 years prior to the publishing of Dracula.
The extract reads: 
  "The sexton of the church of St Eustace, at Paris, amazed to find frequently a particular lamp extinct early, and yet the oil consumed only, sat up several nights to perceive the cause. At length he detected that a spider of surprising size came down the cord to drink the oil. A still more extraordinary instance of the same kind occurred during the year 1751, in the Cathedral of Milan. A vast spider was observed there, which fed on the oil of the lamps. M. Morland, of the Academy of Sciences, has described this spider, and furnished a drawing of it. It weighed four pounds, and was sent to the Emperor of Austria, and is now in the Imperial Museum at Vienna." 
It is not inconceivable that a spider or other church-dwelling creature would be able to extract some nutrients from oil lamps at that time; the oil was essentially a product of whale blubber. However, the main barrier to a spider growing to weigh four pounds (about the same as a smallish rabbit) would be the biological limitations on its respiratory system supporting a body that size. 
I'm unable to conclusively substantiate what happened to the body from my own research; I could swear that I remember reading somewhere that the body of the spider was eventually lost in a fire.
