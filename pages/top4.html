            <p>the Fall of 2014On a Monday morning in the Fall of 2014 I was visiting Virginia City, NV. I stopped in to the 
Old Washoe Club with a buddy. While he was in the back museum I casually took a couple pictures in the mirror located in the middle of the building. Several people have reported seeing an apparition of a woman on the staircase. Out of four pictures this is the only one I got with what looks like a woman standing over my shoulder. Note I’m 6’4” tall and was only about a foot away from the back wall and no one was in the small room with me. Decide for yourself.</p>
