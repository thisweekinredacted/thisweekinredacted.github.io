            <h1>Finally, after 12 years in this house, </h1>
            <p>my husband had an experience he can't explain awayWhen we bought this house (built in 1909), I specifically asked if it were haunted. The owners had no idea because they purchased it as a foreclosure and never lived in it. After we moved in, I found out it was supposedly the most actively haunted house in the neighborhood. Great, a house with a reputation for being haunted ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è our last house, btw, was not haunted but built on land that used to be a cemetery. 
Included the pic of the house because people say our house looks haunted lol As you can see from the ladder and the state of the porch, we are doing more work on the house. It's not surprising the activity is picking up again.
The other night, he got up to use the bathroom. The bathroom used to be a butler's pantry and connects the formal dining room (which we turned into a bedroom) to the kitchen. The bathroom mirror was opened so that while you couldn't see yourself you could see into the kitchen. 
He said he saw the reflection of a male with a full head of hair walk across the kitchen. My husband is bald.  Woke him right up. He ran into the kitchen thinking someone broke in. Naturally no one was there. He's been having trouble sleeping ever since. He's very creeped out about it and is talking about blessing the house (again). 
He's explained away every other experience, but this one he can't. Example: our front door has a very distinct sound. We were sitting around watching TV and heard the front door slam shut. We thought maybe one of the kids had gone outside. The kids were upstairs and the front door was locked. He thinks one of the kids just have slammed the door then somehow ran past us without us seeing. 
The orbs, random foot steps, music, voices... He has always said it's our imagination.</p>
