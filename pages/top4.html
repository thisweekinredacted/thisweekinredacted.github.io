            <h1>Bought an antique ash tray and we </h1>
            <p>started seeing the lights turn on by themselvesI was checking on my blind dog on my camera and saw the kitchen light turn on and off and it continued until I remotely turned on my led strips. She got spooked and left the room( she is blind and doesnâ€™t move around throughout the night much) 
This was 2 days after bringing home this ashtray and noises have started and everyone in the house hears them independently. 
(Will include ash tray photos in comments) </p>
