            <h1>Think we saw </h1>
            <p>something.My friend and I go on regular walks at night and our topic of choice is usually paranormal shit. The other night I left him to go gym and he decided to walk back alone and he went the long spooky way and took some pictures as he was walking. We always take pictures of the stars and for our Instagram stories of randoms shit. I think it could just be a person but the silhouette and outline of this shape is really strange. At first we thought it was an animal but after he increased the exposure we could see something. I know itâ€™s 100 percent unedited other than the exposure increase because I saw the original photograph on his phone and the time he took the picture on his iPhone. Any ideas of what it may be and any expert able to give us some tips? Today we went near the area again at night and heard noises as if we were being followed but we were to spooked to go into to the depths of the darkness.</p>
