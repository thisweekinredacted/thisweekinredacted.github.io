            <h1>A strange encounter near a government </h1>
            <p>facility.I was just reminded about a strange guy I encountered while working the register on a food truck near a government facility. NM, USA
A little under 4 years ago I was working a typical shift running the register on a fairly busy food truck near a government facility. We would average 50+ customers for lunch and most were regulars, but we had a lot of new faces every day.
One day I get this very average looking white guy, non-descript, I couldn't pick him out in a line up. He comes to the window and asks, "what is this?". Unamused I tell him "food truck, what do you want?". He looks confused and says something along the lines of "what do you serve on this food truck?" I point to the sandwich board beside the window and wait. He glances at the board then asks, "what is on a hamburger?" like he's never heard of it before.
I list off the regular ingredients quickly, "burger, bun, choice of cheese, LTOP, and side of fries." He considers it for a moment then asks, "what's a quesadilla?" Some people don't know so I tell him what's in it.
He goes through each of the 8 or 9 items we had asking the same questions about everything. He decides on a cheeseburger and I give him the total, I think it was $12?He stares at me then hands me a $20 bill and walks away. I send the ticket to my grill and and put the change aside for when he comes back for his food. I never assume a tip unless it was mentioned as such.
He comes back for the food and opens the container and kinda stares at it in wonder. I offer him his change and he looks at me like he's never seen me before and walks away without his change.
His tone was very deliberate, like he was trying to not sound weird. The accent wasn't foreign but I couldn't pinpoint what region it was from (southern, Boston, Midwest, etc.). I've spoken to people from all over the world and can usually pinpoint a dialect but this guy was just off.</p>
