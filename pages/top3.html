            <h1>Any truth to this? Janet Ossebard had </h1>
            <p>been missing for a few weeks and was found dead, police claim itâ€™s a suicide. Anyone able to confirm?I never cared too much for her documentaries (too much of a partisan right bias, too much favoritism claiming DT was the guy going to save us all), but it IS odd that another researcher suicided. 
Are they tying up loose ends? Is this blown out of proportion? What do you think.</p>
