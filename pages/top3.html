            <p>She said "Hi" and I started prayin'!I didn't believe that this house was haunted. Maaaaaybe I was wrong?
Something said "hi" from the doorway behind my right shoulder. It was loud and very clearly annunciation. The security system caught no movement or other activity except for me moving around for 0130 snickity snacks. The dogs stayed by the bedroom door in the background and never made a peep...very unusual for them to NOT ask nicely for me to share especially when I've got cereal.  Our roomie, Jackie, confirmed that she was asleep. </p>
