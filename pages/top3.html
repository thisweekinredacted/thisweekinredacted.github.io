            <h1>Yelling at ghosts might actually be </h1>
            <p>more effective than you think.My house was pretty eerie for a the first 16 or so years of my life (for reference I’m 20 now) and every now and then I’d have this weird feeling of being watched when I was alone, I’d feel someone tap/grab my shoulder and turn around to no one being there, I’d hear my name get called by my mom when I was home alone, sometimes even feel a chill go through my body and even had very bad sleep paralysis for the longest time where I would be watched while I slept by a figure that was in the hallway even at some points while I was awake there would seem to be a dark figure ducking behind a corner in the basement. Anyways, one night I was alone watching my dogs because my parents where at the hospital staying the night since my dad had heart surgery and mom didn’t want to leave him there alone all night. I think I had just turned 17 and it was dark out maybe around the 10:30-11:00 range my dogs where acting a little more odd than usual, I went into the basement to play on my PlayStation and usually on a normal day my dogs would follow me down there because they enjoyed laying next to me but that night they laid at the top of the steps which I thought was odd. I was playing COD and kept dying in this free for all match to this dude who was camping and talking his shit in game chat which was really getting on my nerves. After the match, still pretty irked I looked over and saw the usual figure duck behind a corner I really didn’t acknowledge this how I usually would which would be me getting paranoid and running upstairs for the rest of the night but my anger at COD outweighed my fear. Then this picture we had leaning against a wall that was by the corner where the figure went fell over and the frame broke. This sent me, I started yelling and cussing and saying stuff like “JESUS FUCKING CHRIST DO YOU EVER QUIT?!?” And “SWEAR TO GOD I WILL FLOOD THIS BASEMENT WITH HOLY WATER AND DROWN YOU IN IT IF YOU KEEP KNOCKING SHIT OVER YOU CLUMSY FUCKING APPARITION THAT WASNT EVEN QUALIFIED TO BE ACCEPTED INTO HELL” and since that night all ghostly stuff has ceased. I’d like to think it got it to go away or at least fuck off with bothering me.</p>
