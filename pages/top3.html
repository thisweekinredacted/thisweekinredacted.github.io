            <h1>Took this spooky pic back in 2009 at </h1>
            <p>Oxford Castle. Story in the descriptionI took this spooky photo way back in 2009, during a visit with my family to Oxford Castle/Prison. The photo was an accidental/unintentional shot taken on my digital camera while we were climbing back down the stairs from tower.  
It appears to show a cloaked figure/white dress in the doorway. The spooky bit, is that I am quite certain that the room was completely empty with no ‘white dress’ as me and my cousin poked our heads in the doorway during the climb up the tower. I hadn’t noticed this photo until we returned home and I was browsing pics from the day.
Apparently there is a commonly seen ghost at the castle of Empress Matilda, who is said to have been draped in a white cloak/robe.
I also know that the castle does run ghost tours during the nights with staff dressed up as characters from the castles past, which would make sense but as I said this room was empty and we didn’t see any  other costumes on display or staff dressed in character during our trip which was in the middle of day. 
I am wondering if anyone from Oxford or who is familiar with the castle can help explain /debunk my spooky photo lol. I don’t really believe in ghosts but this has always given me the heebie jeebies. 
What makes my skin crawl is how eerily similar the various artists renditions of Empress Matilda’s escape from Oxford castle are to my photo of ‘the ghost’.</p>
