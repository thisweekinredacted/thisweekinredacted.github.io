            <h1>The United States took Flight </h1>
            <p>MH370If you're not familiar, Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared March 8th (March 7th UTC) in 2014. There are many commonly known narratives about it's fate including the idea that it was a suicidal pilot that flew by his home town to say goodbye and took the plane on an 6+ hour joyride. This narrative is false and there's no evidence to support it. That's how easy it is for the media to convince people of a lie. The official story is that we don't know what happened to the plane.
What really happened is that the United States took this plane and lied about it to the world.
The mainstream media is under complete control by the US government, and that's why they didn't press on the fact that we have satellites scanning the entire globe persistently with a system called SBIRS. There were US/Thai exercises going on in the Andaman sea where the plane flew directly past. We also have bases such as Diego Garcia that have capabilites to track the plane from takeoff to it's disappearance. There is no possible way the United States doesn't know exactly what happened to the plane. We know a plane the size of a 777 can't disappear without being tracked and can't crash into the ocean without leaving a debris field.

Every FOIA request into the plane to any agency is met with a 2009 Obama era exemption that withholds the information 'in the internet of national defense or foreign policy,' including one by Olry Taitz in 2014 to the NSA. This would not be the case if they there wasn't something to hide.
Interest of National Defense or Foreign Relations
So what happened to the plane? We can say with a high degree of confidence that it was a lithium ion battery fire related to the 487lbs onboard, two pallets of which went unscreened and were in the forward cargo bay near the Main Equipment Center (MEC), also known as the electronics bay. 19 witnesses corroborate this event and all have had to be discredited to invent a phony narrative of the plane flying into the South Indian Ocean. This includes Mike McKay who saw the plane on fire when the batteries first ignited, 9 witnesses along the coast who hear loud noises at the exact same time, 8 fishermen who see the plane flying low as the crew battles the fire and the pilots try to keep the passengers alive, and finally Kate Tee who an hour later sees the plane glowing orange with no navigation lights, spewing dark smoke. The orange glow is due to a chemical reaction from the Halon 1301 releasing Bromine, a halogen gas.

The plane didn't fly for 8 hours to fuel exhaustion and that's why the official search didn't find one single piece of the plane above or below water, any black boxes, and why there was no radar signals or acoustic detections anywhere in the South Indian Ocean. If the plane crashed at 15,000ft per minute as Mike Exner of the Independent Group has claimed to me, it would have shattered into thousands of pieces. He claims all the pieces of the plane sunk, but that's not how that works. Much of the plane would have floated including all the plastic, luggage, floatation devices, bodies, etc. The debris field would have been miles wide and we would have seen it on satellite the next day.
Searched everywhere with 80+ boats\/planes and submersibles and found nothing
Over a year later a few pieces linked to the plane wash ashore. The media doesn't report that no unique serial numbers were used, the unique serial plate was missing from the flaperon. Instead they used part numbers. Only a tiny fraction of the plane is acocunted for with all the combined debris found. A couple of those pieces have clear scortch/burn marks on them. Not reported is that a B777 fire suppresion device washed up in the Maldives just weeks after the plane disappeared and was ignored despite having visible serial numbers on it.

It was this plane due to the 20 Freescale Semiconductor scientists onboard, far too many for a commercial flight. Freescale was linked to room temperature superconductive microchip development by a 2005 National Security Agency (NSA) report. They had just developed a microchip so small it fit in the dimple of a golf ball. The company was linked to US Aerospace and defense.
NSA report references Freescale nine times
If it was a fire, why the cover up? Enter the MH370 videos. There's not a lot of reason to create an elborate cover up including multiple countries and all western media, unless whatever is being hidden is for national defense purposes. The United States, and/or one of the defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, used advanced technology unknown to the public on the plane. Two perfectly insync videos dating just days/weeks after the plane went missing corroborate this event. The event we see could be cloaking or annihilation, but both are unlikely due to the smoke trail stopping and the lack of a larger release of energy, respectively. The event seems to be, despite how hard it is to believe, a superluminal event. 'Teleportation' of a macro sized object.

The MH370 videos are the reason for the coverup because this technology is not just about there being a unification theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity (ER=EPR), it's because this technology can be used to create a doomsday weapon that would destroy the entire planet in an instant.
So why wouldn't Russia and/or China blow the whistle on this? First, because no one would believe them. Second because this is spycraft at the highest levels of geopolitics. And third, they did. Russia put out a report not covered in western media that the United States put a package on the plane from the Alabama Maersk where two SEALs were mysteriously found dead, both overdosed at the same time just two weeks before the plane went missing. China hacked Malaysia's government the day after the plane went missing and stole crisis meeting minute notes and classified information about the plane. They also released satellite images 5 days after the plane went missing which seem to show three orbs in a triangle formation. It was reported as debris in the South China Sea but none was found, but in reality was most likely spycraft. A message to the US Government - "we know what you did."

I have been investigating this case for over five months and done over 60 podcasts including Tim Pool and Alex Jones. I am absolutely certain that the United States is lying or witholding information that would reveal the true fate of MH370. You don't need to trust or believe me because I've made the evidence publicly available to all. Even if you can't believe in advanced technology kept secret from us, please help get the truth for the families and victims of the plane.

Lastly I want to send a message to a man named Lieutenant Commander Edward C. Lin. Thank you for leaking these videos and revealing the truth to the world, despite the fact that we ignored them for over nine years. You are not a traitor. You are the hero we deserve.
