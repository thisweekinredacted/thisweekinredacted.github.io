            <h1>They saved my aunt’s life that night… </h1>
            <p>whoever they areBack in the day, when my aunt was a newborn and my dad was a toddler, they lived in a haunted apartment for a short while. My grandma is the one who told me this story. She noticed a lot of weird things going on but never felt threatened or scared. One night, everyone was fast asleep when my grandma heard her name being called. My grandfather wasn’t home and my dad & aunt were the only other ones there so she shrugged it off. But then she heard her name being called again, louder. The second time, the voice also said “check the baby”. She went to go check on my aunt and she had wrapped her blanket around her neck and was starting to choke. This was back in the late ‘60s before anyone knew that blankets were causing infant deaths. They saved my aunt’s life that night… whoever “they” are.</p>
