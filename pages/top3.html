            <h1>Number 3: The MH370 Videos Are </h1>
            <p>/r/conspiracy</p>
            <p>RealHello r/conspiracy! This is Ashton from Twitter and I have been writing about the MH370 videos for the past month. They are real leaked military videos.
I don't want you to believe me I want to convince you with the facts. This isn't all of the facts, just some of the most compelling;
The Videos- Oldest Archive is a satellite stereoscopic video from Regicideanon with an Archive upload date of May 19, 2014. The description reads "Received March 12, 2014 Source: Protected"

​
Interestingly there's a higher quality version without stereoscopic capability uploaded in Aug of 2014, indicating that it's unlikely Regicide was the original source of the videos.
​
vimeo higher quality version released Aug

It is currently presumed this stereoscopic satellite footage was taken by USA-229 which was at the right location at 18:40UTC to take the video we see here given the coordinates we can see at the bottom of the original video.

The thermal video was released in June 2014 and is of an MQ-1C Gray Eagle. This video was leaked because we ignored the first video proof. In this video a thermal layer has been added to the camera. It appears as though the purpose of adding the color was to see how the orbs move, and to notice that they are not normal technology, they are floating and being pulled forward somehow.

You can actually see the orbs spinning on their axis with the thermal layer

notice the dark trails lead the orbs trajectory
As to the strongest evidence;
NO DEBRIS FIELD. This is impossible. A 777 crashing into the Ocean would have caused a debris field visible from space for days, but the official search didn't find a single piece of the plane above or underwater. The single piece that has been tied to the plane wasn't found by the official search and was tied to the plane by a non unique serial number. Even if this piece is part of MH370, which is highly contested, it is not inconsistent with the energetic event we see.
The lack of debris field is why Jeff Wise and Florence De Changy, smart individuals, came up with alternate theories.
There is a Witness. Katherine 'Kate' Tee saw the plane in the location we see with the coordinates in the video. Her testimony is alarming. She mentions being too afraid to talk about what she saw. She admits she saw a glowing orange plane at a low altitude so low she thought it may be landing. She never changed her story and 8 years later until she went silent believed there was a coverup. I personally believe she directly saw the events of our videos and has been scared to tell people since.
The timing and location of the witness make it guaranteed by all flightpaths that she saw the plane.

Kate Tee's last Twitter Post
The Ping Data - It turns out that the narrative of this plane going to the South Indian Ocean is a complete fabrication. There's no evidence at all the plane went there. I went ahead and looked at this excel data of pings that comes from Victor of the Independent Group, and there's an alarming anomaly at 18:40UTC in the data.
18:40UTC is the time when the plane is near Nicobar Islands, the coordinates in the video, Kate Tee, and the time the Independent Group claims the plane made a hard turn to the SIO.
At 18:40UTC in the SU Log tab of the data, the data looks like it's interrupted. The 18:40UTC time logs begin to show a bunch of rows of 0s, then from 19:40-23:15UTC there's 10 rows total of data, compared to hundreds of pages previously for each ping of the flight. This data looks like either something happens at 18:40UTC, or the data has been manipulated and the extra rows inserted.
​
Notice at 18:40UTC this weird anomaly begins in the data
​
You can see 5 hours of data gets condensed into 10 rows. Up until this point every time stamp has pages of data. There also appears to be a pattern in this data.
Lastly, the Pilot Suicide Narrative is also complete fiction. In a suicide scenario the pilot would have crashed the plane. The pilot could not disable all four transponders, and certainly not within the 64 second time window. Everyone has supported the pilot from officials to his wife. He was an experienced pilot with 18,000 flight hours that everyone loved. There is no indication in the events of a suicide and the idea that he flew by Penang, the largest airport that can accommodate a 777 in an emergency scenario, to say goodbye to his hometown, is laughable.
If you want to read more about any of these topics, you can check out my twitter "Ashton" or hashtag, #MH370x. This evidence only scratches the surface I've written much more.
So if they teleported a plane, where did it go? Everyone assumes Diego Garcia, and there's evidence. EXIF data from a Phillip Wood photo, eye witness accounts from the islands just north of the base, and lookalikes from the facebook of Diego Garcia that match the crew. In addition to this there's been tens of millions of underground construction contracts awarded.
There are two main theories for the events of the videos that are supported by the evidence;

Espionage - reverse engineered wormhole tech to steal the semi-conductor scientists on board as they may have cracked superconductivity 9 years ago. May be a shadow arms race for this tech. The US is filming in this scenario because they're conducting an operation.
UFO Encounter - An emergency scenario arises at 17:21UTC that interrupts the electromagnetic electronics and possibly causes a fire onboard the plane. The plane attempts to go to Penang but cannot land, makes communication with US Military who is having exercises with Thailand. The US films the ending of the encounter as they track the plane.

There could be other possibilities but these have the most support. This appears to be the largest verifiable conspiracy of all time.
