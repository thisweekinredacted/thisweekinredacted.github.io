            <h1>Coincidence or God really </h1>
            <p>listened?Sorry for any grammatical mistake.
This is the event when I was about 13 years old. There was an old type of computer in our house whose monitor was like an old TV. At that time flat LED screens were in trends. I wanted that flat LED monitor but I didn't tell this to my parents. 
If I talk about my childhood habits, I belong to a religious family and used to worship God every evening during my childhood. One day a great desire arose in my mind, I thought I should have a flat screen monitor and then I went to do the evening worship as usual.
While doing worship, I was thinking of getting a new monitor and then the most unexpected thing happens.
As soon as I came out of the worship room, I saw that my father and elder brother were coming into the room with a flat screen LED. They told me that they went to one of my uncles And one of his friends had an extra monitor, so he gave it to us. I think god really heard me that day or it could be a big coincidence. 
But even today i realize how all this happened so quickly. A second after i finished the worship, my father came with the monitor. Do god really exist and listening to us all time?</p>
