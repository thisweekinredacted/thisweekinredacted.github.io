            <p>UAP aren't just classified black budget American tech??Besides the US Defense's word. It sounds like our defense budget is soooooo ahead of its time that they rather keep the American people and our foreign adversaries guessing and thinking it's aliens. It seems like the perfect covert response to keep people from exploring our oceans and skies further. And ofc the pilots who have witnessed this phenomenon are above their pay grade or not in the need to know regarding even US Navy and Air Force sightings. I don't doubt at all that they witnessed these encounters but wouldn't the perfect training grounds for OUR tech be within our borders testing on our own military personnel since they are the best of the best they seem like the perfect test subjects.This all only came to mind when I find out in the 60s we had built crafts that could go 4,500mph. So isn't it fair to assume that 50 years later it wouldn't be a stretch that we have capabilities to go over 20,000mph. I may be grasping for straws but it's hard to really gauge how far ahead we are technologically advanced without a reference point and even harder to jump to aliens being the conclusion when we don't even know what our unlimited military budget and best and brightest scientific minds are really capable of because it is classified. I would feel a lot better at least if it's just US flexing our muscles and testing waters than an alien invasion just saying.</p>
