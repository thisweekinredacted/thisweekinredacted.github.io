            <p>University of Ica just announced that, after studying the Nazca mummies for four years in person, they conclude that the bodies are authentic, nonhuman, and unknown to science. 11 scientists and doctors employed by the university signed.Congratulations!
Important to note: no one who has come to study the bodies in person in Peru in the past four years has concluded that they are fabricated. Anyone who has called them fake worldwide are always those who have not come to study them in person.
Also, The University of Ica is a SUNEDU accrediated unverisity, which is the highest accreditation Peru can give to a university. No one questions their authenticity as far as following the scientific method in their studies.
I don’t know where your personal goal posts are, but this crosses mine for sure. I believe!
EDIT: This has not yet been published on the university’s website, but the following letter was read from the congressional hearing with the university’s permission:

Statement from the San Luis Gonzaga University of Ica on the Case of the Desiccated Three-Digit Nazca Bodies
The National University of San Luis Gonzaga (UNSLG) of Ica, Peru, through its research team, wishes to address the national and international scientific community, as well as the authorities and the general public, to report on our study regarding the desiccated three-digit bodies with both human and reptilian characteristics that have become known in the media as the Nazca mummies. These mummies were discovered in the provinces of Palpa and Nasca, in the department of Ica, Peru. Over time, this finding has gained notoriety in the media, generating controversy and debate. In this context, we wish to clarify and communicate the following:


On August 1, 2019, the San Luis Gonzaga National University of Ica, Peru, received four desiccated bodies with both human and reptilian characteristics. These specimens were handed over by maintaining the confidentiality of the source of information according to the second article, subsection 18, of the Political Constitution of Peru. The delivery of these bodies was carried out for the purpose of their custody, conservation, and the conducting of research aimed at clarifying the authenticity of said desiccated specimens.


The largest body, which we call Maria, has a size similar to that of a human but with notable anatomical differences, including an elongated skull and the presence of three digits on both hands and feet. The osteological analysis of the limbs shows structural harmony and congruence without evidence of phalange mutilation and instead shows inflammatory sequelae in the dorsal spine and feet, except in the case of the smallest body that we have named Wawa.


The smaller bodies, approximately 60 cm in length, exhibit a morphological and anatomical structure that differs significantly from the human one. The skin has morphological and histological characteristics resembling those of reptiles, and both hands and feet are three-digited. In addition, they have voluminous skulls, and their bone and joint system generally differs notably from human anatomy, showing unique and sui generis atypical features. It is significant to highlight that no rigid or metallic elements of union and support have been found in the joints of the entire body. Due to the uniqueness of these bodies and the marked anatomical and structural differences, more exhaustive investigations are required to better understand their nature.


Metallurgical analysis carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of a pectoral metallic implant revealed an important finding. It was determined that the implant is composed of an alloy of various metals, with osmium being the predominant element. It is noteworthy that osmium is an element that was officially discovered by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in 1803. Owing to its electrical properties, osmium is used in the manufacturing of some electronic devices and in the production of sensors. Additionally, the microscopic study through optical metallography has revealed the existence of a matrix of microstructures with microporosities and microinclusions in the implant.


However, despite the advances that point towards the confirmation that these bodies are biological and real and the presence of osmium in a metallic implant, it is evident that more exhaustive studies are needed due to the marked morphological and structural differences that have been detected through comparative anatomy. Therefore, it is important to highlight that these preliminary results are not conclusive.


During the period of custody and conservation of the desiccated bodies, our research team, mostly composed of medical specialists, has faced multiple obstacles and difficulties in the execution and proper completion of the investigations. These challenges include the pandemic, budgetary limitations, lack of institutional support, lack of logistics, necessary equipment and technology, as well as legal interference by entities such as the Ministry of Culture and the Public Ministry, among others. Despite these obstacles, we have managed to carry out imaging studies based on radiographs and tomographies using resources provided by the researchers themselves and metallurgical studies with the support of the National University of Engineering (UNI).


It is important to emphasize that at no time has the research team claimed that these bodies belong to extraterrestrial beings. Our approach has been focused on the study of biological bodies of unknown origin that existed in ancient times but are not human. Our approach is based on rigorous study and the search for answers within the realm of science, without making speculative claims about the nature of these bodies.


It is important to stress that from the beginning, no member of the research team has been motivated by media, political, economic interests, or any other kind.


Our sole intention has been to carry out scientific research in order to rigorously determine whether the desiccated three-digit humanoid bodies are authentic or forged, whether they are of biological origin or not, and to unveil the mystery surrounding their authenticity. Our commitment has been to the advancement of scientific knowledge and the search for objective answers regarding these specimens.


Finally, as a result of our investigations, the research team has concluded that the studied desiccated bodies are completely authentic from a biological point of view and show no signs of having been tampered with or artificially assembled. Our scientific approach has been rigorous, and the results contribute to the authenticity of these bodies.
