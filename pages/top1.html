            <h1>1979 NFL game halted due to unknown </h1>
            <p>objects above the sky.This is located in Minnesota, Three Rivers Stadium. I was viewing NFL crazy moments and seen this clip from 1979. I’m trying to understand what this object is, as they’re in a pair.
My first impression was jellyfish UAP, but this seems very spherical, rather than a blob object. Why hasn’t this been shared?
Thoughts on this as there’s no drones or video altering software?</p>
