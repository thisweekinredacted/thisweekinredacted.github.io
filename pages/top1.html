            <p>trip and scared to go back homeSo for context i live in a gated condo in a very quiet part of town. Barely any movement past 9pm. This time of the year, there's maybe 6 apartments occupied, as all tge rest are used for summer holidays. My apartment is on the ground floor and my only direct neighbours are not there. Hardly anyone walks on the back during the night.
I'm currently away from home for work, and when the cleaner went there yesterday,  li asked her to set up the camera just for security.
Video was about 2/3h after she left, just after sunset. Like somethin that went to examine the new item on the dresser. Since then, there's been countless videos of smoke and strange sounds like bangs and others that sound like voices. Mostly late at night, when the condo is supposed to be dead silent. Btw all the doors and windows are locked, nothing was left open.
I wanted to attach the whole thing but I'm still learning how to use reddit. I really need your input as im terrified of going back home now....
How can I post the whole thing?</p>
